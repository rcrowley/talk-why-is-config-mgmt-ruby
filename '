# Why is configuration management software written in Ruby?

# TODO Intro



!SLIDE bullets

# Puppet



!SLIDE bullets

# Puppet

* There once was a systems administrator named Luke who didn't want to use CFEngine anymore...



!SLIDE bullets

# Puppet

* Ruby won out over Python and Perl.
* The autoloader is the frequently cited reason.



!SLIDE bullets

# Puppet autoloader

* `glob` for source files.
* Each one registers itself using an internal DSL.



!SLIDE bullets

# Puppet internal DSL

	@@@ Ruby
	Puppet::Type.newtype(:package) do
	  # ...
	  def insync?
	    # ...
	  end
	  # ...
	end



!SLIDE bullets

# Internal DSLs

* Give one kind of context while taking another away.



!SLIDE bullets

# Internal DSLs

	Puppet::Type.newtype(:package) do
	  # ...
	end

* It's obvious this introduces a type.
* It's not obvious what Ruby code goes here.



!SLIDE bullets

# Internal DSLs

## These are questions I shouldn't have to ask:

* Can I define classes, modules, and/or methods in this scope?
* What is the fully-qualified name of a constant defined in this scope?
* Can I `return` in this scope?



!SLIDE bullets

# Puppet resources

	@@@ Puppet
	package { "ruby": ensure => installed }
	file { "/etc/sysctl.conf":
		ensure => file,
		group => "root",
		mode => 0644,
		owner => "root",
		source => "puppet:///sysctl.conf",
	}

* Orthogonal resources.
* Puppet makes its best-effort.



!SLIDE bullets

# Puppet logging



!SLIDE bullets

# WTF?

	puppet agent --verbose



!SLIDE bullets

# Seriously, WTF?

	puppet agent --verbose --debug --trace



!SLIDE bullets

# Puppet logging

* Uses syslog-appropriate levels.
* Color-coded if logging to a TTY.



!SLIDE bullets

# Chef



!SLIDE bullets

# Chef versus Puppet

## This is not a religious war

* Functionally similar.
* Philisophically different.



!SLIDE bullets

# Chef

* External Ruby DSL.
* Internal Ruby Ruby.



!SLIDE bullets

# Chef resources

	@@@ Ruby
	package "ruby" do
	  action :install
	end
	cookbook_file "/etc/sysctl.conf" do
	  group "root"
	  mode 0644
	  owner "root"
	  source "sysctl.conf"
	end



!SLIDE bullets

# Chef insides

	@@@ Ruby
	require 'chef/resource'

	class Chef
	  class Resource
	    class Package < Chef::Resource
	      # ...
	    end
	  end
	end



!SLIDE bullets

# External DSLs

## Homegrown grammar versus piggybacking Ruby

* Not better.  Not worse.



!SLIDE bullets

# Internal DSLs

## "What scope is that?" versus Ruby Ruby

* This is not the place to get fancy.



!SLIDE bullets

# Whatever, I still like Puppet better

* Let's drink beer and argue about it, though.



!SLIDE bullets

# Despite their differences, Puppet and Chef both codify common systems administration tasks

* That sounds like how people used to use Perl.



!SLIDE bullets

# Ruby as a better Perl

* First-class regular expressions like Perl.
* Backtick operator like Perl and shell.
* Relaxed parentheses like Perl.



!SLIDE bullets

# Ruby as a _better_ Perl

* Blocks are better than subroutine references.
* Real objects are better than fake objects.  No more structs full of function pointers!



!SLIDE bullets

# RubyGems == CPAN

* No release management or feature freezes.
* Double-edged sword.



!SLIDE bullets

# RubyGems for people on-call

* Regression testing.
* Semantic versioning.
* Slow-and-steady release cycle.



!SLIDE bullets

# RubyGems for people on-call

* Stability first.
* No one wants to depend on a moving target.



!SLIDE bullets

# Rake

* A better GNU `make`.
* External Ruby DSL.  Internal Ruby Ruby.



!SLIDE bullets

# Rake

task :deploy do
  sh "git push production master"
end
file "foo.o" => "foo.c" do |t|
  sh "gcc -o foo.o foo.c"
end



!SLIDE bullets

# Rake

## Dependency programming

* Start with a goal.
* Satisfy its prerequisites first, recursively.
* If a prerequisite cannot be satisfied, abort.



!SLIDE bullets

# Rake

* Intended for interactive use.
* Logging isn't _as_ necessary with fail-fast execution.



!SLIDE bullets

# Capistrano

## `ssh`-in-a-`for`-loop meets Rake

* Dependency-oriented but works on multiple hosts in parallel.



!SLIDE bullets

# Capistrano

	$ cap foo
	  * executing `foo'
	  * executing "echo foo >&1"
	    servers: ["rcrowley.org"]
	    [root@rcrowley.org] executing command
	 ** [out :: root@rcrowley.org] foo
	    command finished
	  * executing "echo foo >&2"
	    servers: ["rcrowley.org"]
	    [root@rcrowley.org] executing command
	*** [err :: root@rcrowley.org] foo
	    command finished
	$

* Each host can fail or succeed independently.
* Everything's logged.

# The Marionette Collective

* Orchestration via STOMP publish/subscribe rather than SSH.
* Scalable upgrade to `ssh`-in-a-`for`-loop.



!SLIDE bullets

# The Marionette Collective

* General systems administration gone framework.



!SLIDE bullets

# The Marionette Collective

* Lots of small tools: `mc-ping`, `mc-find-hosts`, `mc-rpc`, and more.
* Compose these to form new programs.  _It's a UNIX system.  I know this._



!SLIDE bullets

# From middleware to MCollective

* Everything starts life as a "script."



!SLIDE bullets

# "Scripts?"

* So trivial you don't need to test them.



!SLIDE bullets

# From script to package

* Idempotence.
* `PUT` not `POST`.
* Whole files.  No appending without conditions.



!SLIDE bullets

# From script to package

## API design

* Principle of least surprise.
* Namespaces.
* Look for generic solutions.  Not too hard, though.



!SLIDE bullets

# Composable Ruby, too

* It's still a UNIX system.



!SLIDE bullets

# Composable Ruby

## Declare inter-file dependencies

* Make it easy to use part of your package.
